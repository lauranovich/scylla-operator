# Scylla Operator
> Kubernetes Operator for Scylla (Beta version :warning:)

[Scylla](https://www.scylladb.com) is a close-to-the-hardware rewrite of Cassandra in C++. It features a shared nothing architecture that enables true linear scaling and major hardware optimizations that achieve ultra-low latencies and extreme throughput. It is a drop-in replacement for Cassandra and uses the same interfaces.

## Quickstart

To quickly deploy a Scylla cluster, choose one of the following options:

* [Generic](docs/source/generic.md): Follow this guide for the general way to use the operator.
* [GKE](docs/source/gke.md): An advanced guide for deploying Scylla with the best performance settings on [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

## Description

Scylla Operator is in **Beta** status.

The scylla-operator is a Kubernetes Operator for managing Scylla clusters. Currently it supports:
* Deploying multi-zone clusters
* Scaling up or adding new racks
* Scaling down
* Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

Future additions include:
* Integration with [Scylla Manager](https://docs.scylladb.com/operating-scylla/manager/)
* Version Upgrade
* Backup
* Restore


## Top-Performance Setup

Scylla performs the best when it has fast disks and direct access to the CPU. To deploy Scylla with maximum performance, follow the guide for your environment:
* [GKE](docs/source/gke.md)


## Bugs
